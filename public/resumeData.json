In addition to having a solid engineering skillset, I don't think there was a single thing he was asked to do that he wasn't willing to tackle - managing and mentoring junior team members, architecting major features, transitioning between back end / front end, and jumping in to lend a hand on native mobile development when needed. His ability to wear many hats and context switch is extremely valuable in a startup environment and will keep him in high demand. I would happily work with Enio again.",
